An ethernet cable doesn't require setup like any other computer
1) To setup wifi through command line edit "wpa-supplicant"

by running :
sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf 

once the file opens put the ssid and password: 
              
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
network={
        ssid="Example"
        psk="Example"

}

ctrl + X then Y to save and exit. 

for some networks wifi wasn't working. Hence static IP was used. The system wasn't able to ping (connect to internet) was there was IP address. 

To see IP address run 'ifconfig'
To ping run 'ping google.com'

2) sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces was used to open network interfaces. 

auto lo
iface lo inet loopback
iface wlan0 inet static
address 192.XXX.XX.XXX - use the IP address shown in ifconfig earlier
netmask 255.255.XXX.X
gateway 192.100.XX.X
broadcast 192.XXX.XX.XXX
allow-hotplug wlan0
iface eth0 inet dhcp
#auto eth0
iface wlan0 inet manual
wpa-roam /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
iface default inet dhcp

'ifconfig' was run in another computer to see netmask, gateway and  broadcast

ctrl + X then Y to save and exit. 

Above can be done in GUI

run 'startx' to boot into GUI
